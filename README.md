# prc-web

`prc-web` is an online prc filetype viewer and editor. Currently it is not deployed, so running for development purposes may require the user to build it separately.

## Building

*Prerequisites:*

- Rust: Cargo, Wasm-pack

- Javascript: Node, Yarn (alternatively npm, if you modify instructions suitably)

*Start the development server:*

- `yarn` to install dependencies

- `yarn build` to create a `dist` folder with the needed files

- `yarn start` to begin a development server
